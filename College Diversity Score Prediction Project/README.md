#### **University Diversity Score Project**

##### **Overview**
This project analyzes and predicts diversity scores for U.S. universities, split between **National Universities** and **Liberal Arts Colleges**. It evaluates diversity in two dimensions:
1. **Student Diversity**
2. **Professor Diversity**

##### **Key Features**
- **Collaborative Effort**: The project was divided into two focus areas:
  - Analysis and predictions for **National Universities**.
  - Analysis and predictions for **Liberal Arts Colleges**.
- **My Role**: I focused on **Liberal Arts Colleges**, specifically:
  - Predicting **Student Diversity** and **Professor Diversity** using machine learning.
  - Developing a base file to generate the necessary datasets for the models.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

##### **My Contributions**
- Worked exclusively on the **Liberal Arts Colleges** dataset.
- Created machine learning models to predict:
  - **Student Diversity**: Identifying factors that impact diversity levels.
  - **Professor Diversity**: Analyzing faculty demographics.
- Developed a reusable base files to automate dataset preparation for the models.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights from the data.
- Designed visualizations to communicate the results clearly.

##### **Team Contributions**
- Team members handled data collection and predictions for **National Universities**.
- Collaborated on final report writing and presentation preparation.

##### **Project Presentation**
The repository includes the **project presentation PPT**, which summarizes:
- Key findings and insights for both university types.
- Prediction methodologies and results.
- Implications for stakeholders.

##### **Future Improvements**
- Test additional machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
- Create an interactive visualization tool for end-users.

##### **Acknowledgments**
Thank you to my teammate, Margaret Nguyen, and Professor Eren Bilen for their efforts in completing the project and for providing valuable feedback throughout.
